# Node-DevelopmentPlan

Just to provide learning, I don't recommend novices to read it directly. I summarize it with a review attitude. Interested friends can make suggestions or add more interesting content. Only 30% have learned how to use it. The remaining 70% is the source code of koa and express. You may notice that `express-base` is not a familiar **MVC** architecture. After learning the whole, I will summarize the Node architecture I have seen in recent years, Build a `tc-node-template` of your own. Come on!
